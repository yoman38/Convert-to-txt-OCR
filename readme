## Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of installing the required dependencies for using a specific set of Python libraries, including Tesseract for text recognition. These libraries are commonly used for working with PDFs, images, text recognition, and office document formats. To begin, make sure you have administrative privileges on your system to install software and modify environment variables.

### Step 1: Install Poppler

**Poppler** is a PDF rendering library that is required for certain PDF manipulation tasks.

1. **For Windows:**
   - Download the latest Poppler's Windows release from the official repository [here](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/tag/v21.03.0).
   - After downloading, extract the contents of the archive to a preferred directory.
   - Copy the path of the `bin` directory within the extracted folder.

### Step 2: Add Poppler to PATH

Adding the Poppler binary directory to your system's PATH environment variable will allow your system to locate and execute the Poppler command-line tools.

1. **For Windows:**
   - Right-click on the "This PC" or "My Computer" icon (or search for "Computer" in the Start menu), and select "Properties."
   - Click on "Advanced system settings."
   - In the "System Properties" window, click the "Environment Variables" button.
   - Under the "System Variables" section, find and select the "Path" variable, then click the "Edit" button.
   - Click "New" and paste the copied path to the Poppler `bin` directory.
   - Click "OK" on all the windows to save your changes.

### Step 3: Install Tesseract OCR

**Tesseract** is an open-source text recognition engine.

1. **For Windows:**
   - Download the Tesseract installer for Windows from the official repository [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
   - Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
   - During installation, make sure to select the option to add Tesseract to the system PATH.

### Step 4: Install Python Packages

The following Python packages are essential for working with various document formats and performing text recognition.

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.

2. Run the following command to install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install PyPDF2 Pillow pytesseract pdf2image python-docx openpyxl python-pptx
   ```

### Congratulations!

You have successfully installed the necessary dependencies for your project, including Tesseract for text recognition. You can now start using the installed Python libraries to work with PDFs, images, text recognition, and various office document formats.

Remember to refer to the documentation of each library for guidance on how to use their features effectively in your Python scripts.
